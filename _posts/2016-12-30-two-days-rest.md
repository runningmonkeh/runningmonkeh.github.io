excerpt: "With January 1st just around the corner, it's time to get ready for the new training program."
---

I took the last two months off running to give my body a break. I ran every day in October to get my body back into it after a hiatus before then. The daily runs were a minimum of one mile a day (anything less would not be considered a run so would not be logged). I found that really helped me. I wasn't going the speeds I may have been used too, but the high frequency of runs certainly helped my body adjust and get back into the swing of things.

I stopped at the end of October and haven't got back into it yet - this was a conscious decision. I decided to give myself to the end of 2016 to rest, recover and do other things. This, sadly, also meant gaining weight whilst I enjoyed the lack of movement and one too many beers, not to mention the Christmas food.. and the food BEFORE Christmas for that matter.

Training kicks off on the 1st January 2017. I may run every day in January just to get back into it again and ease the muscles in slowly with frequent gentle runs, then a proper long distance program starts in February (if not earlier.. who knows).

As a result of my portly weight gain, I'll also be tracking my weight loss here too (mostly for own benefit so that I can see progress... hopefully)

Until January 1st, I'll enjoy another beer. I won't have too many more after then.
