After a long time away from any serious running (work committments), I'm back.

My deferred place for the London to Brighton 100km ultra challenge has now been confirmed and I'm registered to once again attack the gruelling 62 miles in May 2018. This is a challenge I'm really looking forward to and one with a clear goal to beat - sub 15 hours.

That very same day I also registered for another ultra marathon, this time in Cyprus. The Buff Troodos 80km Ultra - [http://www.troodosultra.com/en/route-description/buff-troodos-mountain-ultra-80k/](http://www.troodosultra.com/en/route-description/buff-troodos-mountain-ultra-80k/). A cut off time of 15 hours doesnt sound so bad for an 80km event, but this is trail... pure mountain trail with an elevation gain of around 4.5km. For me that's hardcore stuff.

I haven't done much mountain / trail running, and the only time I did was last September just prior to the event when the organisers held practice runs for the loops. As I'd only just moved out to Cyprus I hadn't entered (the thought hadn't even crossed my mind), but I wanted to go out for an organised run with people. It was only one of the loops, and I was really enjoying myself.

The views were stunning, the terrain challenging. I had a smile on my face speeding down the mountain side. It was more of a semi-controlled slide on the rocks and loose ground as opposed to a run, but it was exhilarating - right up to the point where my right leg, not used to the terrain and effort, gave out and pain shot through my knee. I managed to get down to the halfway point, grab a drink and recover, but decided to play it safe and grab a lift with another runner back to the top of the mountain.

So, I've experienced the terrain (a little), and desperately wanted to set myself a new challenge, something to aim for, and not let that last experience put me off running the mountains.

After registering I realised I only have about 12 weeks of training (*GULP*), so last week I started a rather intensive ultra training plan for 50 mile distances. I was nervous over how it would go, having not really run properly for a while, and it was all about time on tired legs, running 6 days in a row (Tuesday to Sunday).

I'm happy to say that I managed the full week and even ran 2 miles more than I should have done on the plan with a weekly total of 54 miles in six days.

Today (Monday) is a rest day. I'm making the most of it and not going out at all. Tomorrow I start the next week's run with a total of 61 miles minimum to get.

Let's do this.
