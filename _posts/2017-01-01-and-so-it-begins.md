Happy New Year to one and all!

2017 is here, which means it's time to start training and getting back into shape ready for the 100km ultra marathon in May.

## The Scales

The first thing I did this morning was stand on the dreaded scales to see the damage of the last few months.

The initial reading from the scales was as follows:

* Weight: 68.6 kg
* BMI: 22.4
* Body Fat: 24.1%
* Body Water: 48.6%

Weight is not too bad, although I'll certainly start losing some when the miles start adding up.

My BMI is within the normal range, although it can certainly do with dropping a few points.

The biggest shocks for me were the body fat and body water percentages. My body fat reading is at the high end of 'moderate' for my age range, which is not good at all. I need to end up between 8.1 - 19.9%, so clearly a lot of work to be done there.

The body water percentage also needs a lot of work. I'm very aware that I haven't been drinking anywhere near enough water for a while. I used to carry a water bottle with me everywhere, but that clearly hasn't happened for some time. I need to improve this so that I'm somewhere between 50 - 65%.

## Time to get out there

I'm going to start running again today to get back into it, most likely with an easy 5km run just to get the body used to hitting the streets again.

It's clear I have a long way to go but I'm determined.
