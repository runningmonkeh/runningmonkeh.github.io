excerpt: "With a long four-day weekend at my disposal, it's time to build up the miles again."

Easter, the time for families, chocolate and more chocolate.

I had (for the first time in a long time), the full long weekend, from Friday through to Monday. As a result I knew this was the best time to get outside and add some miles to my feet, making the most of the extra recovery days at my disposal.

Saturday 15th April took me on a 10 mile run. I wanted this to be a 13.1 mile distance, but I went out in the mid-late afternoon when the sun was still shining and minimal cloud cover (we were forecast rain in Nicosia, but didn't get any that day, at least not near me), so after 10 miles I decided to call it a day before the sun got to me (bearing in mind that it was still only 20 degrees, not the 35-40 that we'll get in the Summer months). Still, 10 miles is ten more than I had done for a while.

Monday 17th April was a longer run. I was hell-bent on running a half-marathon distance, especially as I was cut short a few days earlier. This time, however, I wanted to run a completely different route, one I had never been on before, for some variation, so I took to some local trails nearby. This also involved intentionally climbing a rather large hill (it was very steep) and getting the shoes muddy in the process (the rain had eventually decided to appear about an hour before I set out). The 13.1 mile distance was covered yesterday - it's been a while since I managed that.

All in all a very active weekend, and I feel better, mentally and physically, as a result.
