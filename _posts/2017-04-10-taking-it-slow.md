excerpt: "Starting from scratch, retraining my brain, legs and body to run slower"

A few months have passed since the initial updates and progress posts, and there's a very good reason for that. Well, two.

## One

I had a biopsy on my toe in February 2017 - a cancer scare which, luckily, turned out to be nothing, but the build up to and recovery from the biopsy severely halted any major progress or running plans I had. I was registered to run a Marathon in Paphos about two weeks after the biopsy. I still went to pick up my race bib and race pack, but on the way home decided that it would be foolish given that the toe had only just healed and I had pretty much zero training for this event.

## Two

The second reason was laziness. Plain and simple. It was mostly mental, and I ended up with a mental block towards going out running; I constantly found reasons not to, and that compounded the matter each time. This was not a mental state I enjoyed being in. Looking back on progress last year, when I moved from 5km twice a week to easily managing an 11 mile run during my lunch breaks, comparing that to current status and progress was soul-destroying.

## The deferral

I came to the obvious conclusion after the biopsy that I would have to defer the ultra race for 2017 as I simply wasn't prepared. Sure, I could have given it a go and walked most of it (assuming I actually made it around), but that would not have been enjoyable; I entered it again to not only raise money for a charity but because I enjoyed it. So, 2017 is no more, but I have deferred to a 2018 entrance instead - the donation page [https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/ultra-2017](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/ultra-2017) is still open so it gives me an extra year to raise as much money as I can, and also much MUCH more time to train again.

I'm really focussed on the training now. I'm dropping the bad habits one by one ( I used to console myself when working long hours by having 'pick me ups' consisting of the occasional jelly sweet.. needless to say the occasional sweet ended up being the entire bag ), and really watching what I eat now too.

I'm also aware that my running has suffered; I don't seem to progress with speed (in fact I'm playing catch up now getting back to the pace I was last year).

I've decided that, as I have a year to really focus on getting into shape, I will retrain how I run. I've read a lot on this and the current plan I've chosen is to try the 80/20 process, where I will force my body to run slow for 80% of my training runs, and 20% at high intensity; this is to stop falling into the trap of running at the 'natural' pace that my body is now used to, which is probably not the optimal pace to run at.

The first step in this plan is to have a week of running slow.. really slow, as in almost walking, as it's a way to force the body to break the habits of the natural pace.

So, the Strava routes for this 'week of slow' will be slow, but it's all part of the plan.
