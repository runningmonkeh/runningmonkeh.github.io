I've been enjoying running again. I've even started to get used to running in the Cyprus sunshine during Summer. A little.

For the last few months a friend of mine, Will, and I have been trying to keep each other going by taking part in a weekly running challenge on the Garmin app. It's really helped the motivation, knowing that you're running with someone, albeit a few thousand miles apart (Will is back in England).

Today Will started his training plan for his first half marathon in September.
I really wanted to keep our running routines going for motivation, and so I decided to run the same training program as him so that we can keep each other going.

The first run was a 4 mile fartlek session. I've NEVER run a fartlek session before. I'm a plodder. I like to run the long distances and lose myself in music in the process. The idea of interval sprints was beyond my comprehension, but I went out and gave it a go. I created a quick routine on my Garmin watch that gave me 5 minutes of warm-up jogging, followed by repeated intervals of 30 second sprints followed by a 3 minute cool-down jog. The idea was to use the watch to tell me when to give it hell and when I could recover, relax a little and catch my breath. That plan worked; you have to love technology sometimes, feeling the gentle buzz on your wrist from the notification telling me to run like a mad man and when to take it easy.

What I hadn't considered was the heat. It's now early June in Cyprus. I know it's hot now (it will get hotter), so I tend to go out in the evening when the sun has done it's business and is on the way out but still light enough to run relatively safely. I think, when I came home, I clocked the temperature at about 32 degrees celsius.

However, the fartlek session was actually quite fun. I found myself actually paying attention to how my body was moving during the periods of sprinting, allowing myself the freedom to change my stride and cadence a little, which actually felt really nice. I came home after this run with a big smile on my face, and I'm now, bizarrely, looking forward to the next fartlek session.
